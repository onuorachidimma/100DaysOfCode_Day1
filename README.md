This is the first day of my Python 100 Days of code from beginner to Pro(Instructor: Angela Yu).
The project for today 'Band name generator' generates a unique Band name from the user inputs.
Here, i applied everything that i learned today including printing, input, variables, new lines, concatenation, string manipulation and debugging.

Task 1
Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.
Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

Expected output:
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')


Task 2
Look at the code in the code below. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
Warning: The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass

#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡
prit(Day 1 - "String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
    print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

Expected Output:
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.


Task 3
Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

Example output:
What is your name? Angela
6


Task 4
Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.

Fix the code below:
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡



#Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
####################################
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

Example output:
a: 3
b: 5
a: 5
b: 3
